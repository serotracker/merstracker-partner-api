  "title": "SeroTracker MERS Prevalence Estimates",
  "description": "This dataset contains a collection of seroprevalence and viral positive prevalence estimates for MERS extracted from various sources by the SeroTracker team.\n Each individual data point represents a primary estimate which was extracted from a particular source and may have various subestimates which give a more detailed look at the group sampled.\n More information about the meaning of the individual fields can be found by looking at the schema present at https://merstracker-partner-api.vercel.app/api-docs/. Everything under \"properties\" in the GeoJSON file conforms to the schema called \"PrimaryMersEstimate\" on that OpenAPI 3 schema. Looking at the descriptions for the fields under that schema will give you a deeper understanding of the meaning of the fields in the GeoJSON file.\n More information about the SeroTracker team as well as the process used to extract this data can be found at https://new.serotracker.com/about/about-our-data.\n SeroTracker is hosted at the University of Calgary's Centre for Health Informatics.",
